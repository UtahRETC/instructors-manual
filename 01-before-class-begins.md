# Before class begins

1. Create a new Slack channel
    - Name should be "python-{part}-{year}". For example, "python-2-2025".
    - Invite instructors, URECT admins, and students.
2. Create a new course on Canvas
    - https://canvas.instructure.com/
    - Name should be "Python {part} {year}". For example, "Python 2 2025".
    - Invite instructors and URECT admins and make them Teachers.
    - Invite students (and make them Students).
    - Create a module for each unit
        - In each module should have the following Text Headers:
            - Unit overview, we can get this text from the "Overview.md" file
              in each unit in the class repo. Usually the first one or two
              paragraphs in the file are what we want to use here.
            - "Resources", this is where we include links to slides and any
              other resources we share.
            - "Class Recordings", this is where we include links to recorded
              classes.
            - "Class Exercises", this is where in-class exercise assignments
              go.
            - "Homework", this is where homework assignments go.
    - Upload all slides to the Files section and place them under "Resources"
      in the corresponding module.
3. Send welcome email
    - Include Slack channel link
    - Include Canvas course link
    - Include first day of class information
